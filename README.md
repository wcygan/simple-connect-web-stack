# simple-connect-web-stack

We will make `simple-web-stack` v2 in this project. It will be modeled similar to `simple-web-stack-v1`

TLDR; https://github.com/wcygan/simple-web-stack but using Go + https://connectrpc.com/ instead of Rust + https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/

We will use the Buf Schema Registry to publish our protobuf schemas. They will be defined locally in the `proto` directory.

Some information on `v1` can be found in [v1](/v1) directory.

Some information on `v2` can be found in [v2](/v2) directory.

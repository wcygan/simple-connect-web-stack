  Key Technical Decisions

  🎯 No Authentication by Design
  - Eliminates 70% of typical web app complexity
  - Faster development iteration
  - Perfect for MVPs and educational use

  🏝️ Islands Architecture (Fresh 2.0)
  - Ship minimal JavaScript to browser
  - Server-side rendering for performance
  - Client-side interactivity only where needed

  ⚡ Rust Backend
  - Zero-cost abstractions for maximum performance
  - Memory safety prevents entire classes of bugs
  - Excellent concurrency for handling multiple users

  🗄️ Type-Safe Database
  - SQLx provides compile-time SQL verification
  - No runtime SQL errors
  - Automatic schema migrations

  Development Experience

  One Command Deployment:
  deno task up  # Starts entire stack in Docker

  Hot Reloading Everything:
  - Frontend rebuilds instantly on file changes
  - Backend recompiles automatically during development
  - Database schema updates seamlessly

  Comprehensive Testing:
  - Unit tests run in parallel for speed
  - Integration tests use isolated databases for reliability
